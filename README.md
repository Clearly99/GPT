## Unity Requirements:
1. Unity 2021.3.8f or greater
2. [Roslyn C# - Runtime DLLs](https://github.com/dilmerv/UnityRoslynDemos) which you can get from the Resources folder. I'm also planning to add the Class Library project to GitHub which should allow you to generate these DLLs yourself.
3. Open any of the available scenes
4. Create an account in [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
5. Get a new [API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and your [API Organization](https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings)
6. Update ChatGPTSettings file located under Assets/Settings/ChatGPT/
